Petroleum (about)
composed of over 100,000 distint chemical compounds. (1)
Unwanted asphaltene phase transitions hinder petroleum production, transportation, and refining
The primary unresolved component of crude oil is asphaltene.(2-4) Understanding the structure of asphaltenes is of immense economic importance(2, 4-8) and a prerequisite to establishing the structureâ€“function relationship in petroleomics
