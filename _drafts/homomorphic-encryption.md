A lot of information that is distributed on the internet should be encrypted more often that it is. For instance, banks must decrypt your data to calculate your net savings or a loan rate. Governments have to decrypt votes to tally who voted for what. And scientists have to perform analysis on decrypted genomes to understand the underlying intricacies. 

Normally, when dealing with sensitive data one will apply [HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/) practices or similar to avoid disclosing private information. Scientists tend to try to black out the identifirs. However, these steps are not far enough. It has been shown that it is possible to determine the identify of [genomic donors even without identifying information](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/321.abstract?ijkey=ac58b82dc3607e2773325c6fe35857dddba82704&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha).
